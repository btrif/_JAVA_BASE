COHESION

- Cohesion refers to what the class (or module) will do. Low cohesion would mean that
the class does a great variety of actions and is not focused on what it should do.
- High cohesion would then mean that the class is focused on what it should be doing,
i.e. only methods relating to the intention of the class.

Example of Low Cohesion:

-------------------
| Staff           |
-------------------
| checkEmail()    |
| sendEmail()     |
| emailValidate() |
| PrintLetter()   |
-------------------
Example of High Cohesion:

----------------------------
| Staff                   |
----------------------------
| -salary                 |
| -emailAddr              |
----------------------------
| setSalary(newSalary)    |
| getSalary()             |
| setEmailAddr(newEmail)  |
| getEmailAddr()          |
----------------------------

COUPLING

- As for coupling, it refers to how related are two classes / modules and how
dependent they are on each other. Being low coupling would mean that changing
something major in one class should not affect the other.

- High coupling would make your code difficult to make changes as well as to maintain
it, as classes are coupled closely together, making a change could mean an entire
system revamp.

All good software design will go for high cohesion and low coupling.
